# Getting started with molecular simulations as a machine learner  
*Date*  

**Disclaimer.** This document contains a curated list of resources I’ve been using to get familiar with molecular simulations and get excited about sampling algorithms. I’m not a chemist, just an ML person who just got into this world, so I’ve surely missed things. Still, I hope these pointers help someone like me bridge the gap from code to atoms!
